Project Name: CSI-2 Image Simulator Lattice CrosslinkFPGA to Jetson Nano
https://www.hackster.io/sam-d/csi-2-image-simulator-lattice-crosslinkfpga-to-jetson-nano-24ac21

The csi2_output.sbx is the CSI-2 IP block generated by the lattice diamond software. You can try to import the block to your project.
If it doesnt work you can re-generate the block using the steps at the hackster.io project.
